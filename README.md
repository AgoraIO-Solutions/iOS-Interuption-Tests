# Agora Interruption Tests

# To Use

1) Add an XCconfig file named "Config", with the appropriate app id for `AGORA_APP_ID`
2) Make sure swift packages have been installed
3) Run the app on an iOS device or an AppleSilicon Device.

# Purpose

Show different options for handling system interruptions generically.

We encourage using CallKit, as demonstrated in this repository, for handling system interactions in favor of directly interacting with AVAudioFoundation for simplicity.
